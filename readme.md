![](demo_test.gif)

### What it does ?
As it is named, this python script automatically logs in  your Facebook account and posts your text-based content on the Facebook Groups you are a member of or any public groups . 


### How does it work or Instructions to use ?
  - ‚úîÔ∏è Open **fb_credentials.json** in notepad, and replace **yourloginemail** with your Facebook login email address, and email address should come between double-quotes. Also, perform the same thing with **yourpassword**, put your Facebook login password there (should come between double quotes) .
  
  - ‚úîÔ∏è To post the desire status/text, open the  **PostingContents.txt**  file in notepad, and add text there (this will not come in the double quotes).
  
  - ‚úîÔ∏è You have to paste the group ids  **facebook.com/groups/:id**   from the url in fb_credentials json file .
  
  - ‚úîÔ∏è After performing the two above steps, run the **fbPost.exe** .  
  

### Is it safe to use, and I have given my Facebook credentials?
- Yes, it is safe. It will use your credentials to only log in to your account, and all posting process will happen in front of you. Once you run the running command in cmd, it will open separate/another chrome, and do the posting work.

**Warning:** Please don't interact with chrome, which will be opened by the script. You can use your other chrome instance to do your work.
