### Is it safe to use, and I have given my Facebook credentials?
- Yes, it is safe. It will use your credentials to only log in to your account, and all posting process will happen in front of you. Once you run the running command in cmd, it will open separate/another chrome, and do the posting work.

**Warning:** Please don't interact with chrome, which will be opened by the script. You can use your other chrome instance to do your work.
